- i created the /dev subdir to build v2, and we can switch it out with v1 of the site when we launch.
    - update css
    - modularize sections and stuff
    - improve user validation
        - no two separate user/no-user header/footer
        - use components to inject different content on various pages (user data or dummy data) depending on user validation

- ok, i made the /my-wins page
- right now, i have this huge form, taking all daily_wins; but i don't think this will work.
- i think i have to revert to the todo.z0rs.org template where folks can edit or add one at a time.
