            <strong><u>Calorie Math</u></strong>
            <ul>
                <li><u>to gain weight</u> - eat MORE calories than you burn in a day</li>
                <li><u>to lose weight</u> - eat LESS calories than you burn in a day</li>
                <li><u>to figure out</u> your <strong>BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)</strong> - estimated number of calories your body burns if it were at rest all day, ie even in a coma your body burns your BMR in calories, <u>and/or</u> <strong>TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)</strong> - estimated number of calories you burn in a day according to your activity level, go to <a href="https://www.calculator.net/bmr-calculator.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calculator.net</a></li>

            <strong><u>Macronutrients</u></strong>
            <br>
            All food breaks down to the three macronutrients (nutrients you need in large amounts, on the scale of grams) and micronutrients (nutrients you need in small amounts, on the scale of milligrams or even micrograms). The three macros are:
            <ul>
                <li><u>Proteins</u> - 4 calories per gram of protein</li>
                <li><u>Carbohydrates</u> - 4 calories per gram of carbohydrates</li>
                <li><u>Fats</u> - 9 calories per gram of fat</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong><u>Body Composition</u></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <u>to maintain body composition</u> - eat the same number of calories your burned that day AND make your macros look like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>about 33% [of that day's total caloric intake] protein </li>
                        <li>about 33% fats + </li>
                        <li>about 33% carbohydrates</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <u>to lose body fat</u> - eat 500 - 1,000 calories LESS THAN the number of calories you burned that day AND make your macros look like: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>increase your proteins (1 - 1.4 grams of protein per lb of bodyweight) + </li>
                        <li>limit your fats (20% min - 35% max of your daily calories) + </li>
                        <li>lower your carbs (the calories you haven't eaten in proteins and fats, can be eaten in carbs)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
